# rcloud.python
Package introducing support for Python via Jupyter Notebooks API

# Configuration

## Jupyter Installation

RCloud integrates with single Jupyter backend, depending on which Python version it integrates with, run one of the following commands:

### Python 2

```{bash}
sudo python -m pip install jupyter
```

### Python 3

```{bash}
sudo python3 -m pip3 install jupyter
```

### Configuring RCloud Jupyter integration

RCloud uses these settings from rcloud.conf:

 * rcloud.python.path - path to Python installation that should be used (e.g. /usr/bin/python3)
 * python.extra.libs - additional Python lib directories (e.g. where Jupyter Python modules got installed)


After (re-)starting RCloud Python integration via Jupyter should work, if it isn't, please read on.


## Python Kernels

If no kernels are configured, Jupyter will create a runtime Python kernel using the same version of Python that Jupyter uses. However if location of Python modules is not standard and/or some of the dependencies have been installed under user-specific location (e.g. /home/[USER_NAME]/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages), then Jupyther will fail to start up such kernel and kernel will need to be explicitly configured (see sections below).



### Python 2 kernel

To register Python 2 kernel run the following command:

```{bash}
python -m ipykernel install --user
```

### Python 3 kernel

To register Python 3 kernel run the following command:

```{bash}
python3 -m ipykernel install --user
```

### Configure PYTHONPATH

In rare occasions when Python modules are installed in non-standard locations, kernel configuration generated in previous steps will need to be updated so PYTHONPATH is correct. The following example shows python3 kernel specification with extra PYTHONPATH locations which hold ipython dependencies:

```{json}

{
 "argv": ["/usr/bin/python3", "-m", "ipykernel_launcher",
          "-f", "{connection_file}"],
 "display_name": "Python 3",
 "language": "python",
 "env": {
    "PYTHONPATH" : "${PYTHONPATH}:/home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages"
  }
}

```

## Runtime Settings

### Listing Kernels

To get a list of registered kernels run this R command in RCloud notebook:
```{R}
rcloud.python:::rcloud.jupyter.list.kernel.specs(rcloud.support:::.session) 
```
Example output:
```{R}
$python2
$python2$resource_dir
[1] "/home/vagrant/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2"

$python2$spec
$python2$spec$env
named list()

$python2$spec$display_name
[1] "Python 2"

$python2$spec$metadata
named list()

$python2$spec$language
[1] "python"

$python2$spec$interrupt_mode
[1] "signal"

$python2$spec$argv
[1] "/usr/bin/python"    "-m"                 "ipykernel_launcher"
[4] "-f"                 "{connection_file}"



$python3
$python3$resource_dir
[1] "/usr/share/jupyter/kernels/python3"

$python3$spec
$python3$spec$env
$python3$spec$env$PYTHONPATH
[1] "${PYTHONPATH}:/home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages"


$python3$spec$display_name
[1] "Python 3"

$python3$spec$metadata
named list()

$python3$spec$language
[1] "python"

$python3$spec$interrupt_mode
[1] "signal"

$python3$spec$argv
[1] "/usr/bin/python3"   "-m"                 "ipykernel_launcher"
[4] "-f"                 "{connection_file}"


```


### Specifying Python Kernel for Notebook

RCloud by default uses 'python' kernel to invoke Python cells. In setups where there are multiple python kernels available (e.g. Python 2 and Python 3) Jupyter will use a kernel with the same version of Python as Jupyter uses.

To specify the kernel version that should be used to invoke Python cells in a notebook, add an R cell to RCloud notebook before all Python cells that sets specific kernel name that should be used:
```{R}
rcloud.python:::.set_python_kernel('python2')
```
> Note.
> 'kernel name' is the key of the kernel in the list of kernels returned by the 'rcloud.jupyter.list.kernel.specs' function.


> Note. 
> If you want to change python kernel after running some Python cells, you will need to refresh RCloud Session, for the above command to take an effect.


# Additional Information

Please refer to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html) for more information about configuration of Jupyter and kernels.
